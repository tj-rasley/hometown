        <section>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>A part of the town was involved in a boundary problem involving New York and Connecticut. A section of
                the town, located in the "Oblong"—the name was given to the disputed oblong strip of land, two miles in
                width forming part of the Eastern boundary of the now Dutchess and Putnam Counties—was settled by Nathan
                Birdsall and his wife Jane Langdon; they were the first pioneer settlers of Quaker Hill, Dutchess, NY.
                He was a native of Long Island and was born around 1700 to Quaker parents. He was one of the surveyors
                of the area and picked his home site during the survey.

                Nathan purchased his land from the Great Nine Partners Patent, prior to moving his family there, erected
                a log house and barn, probably around 1720. The next settler was Benjamin Ferris, a Quaker preacher. It
                was not until 1731, when the one-hundred-year-old dispute as to the boundary between the English in New
                England and the Dutch in New York was settled, that emigration started in any volume. A number of
                Friends began coming from Harrisons Purchase, now a part of Rye, in Westchester County, New York. Their
                Quaker Meeting House is still standing today, and open for visitors.

                In the American Revolution colonial commander in chief George Washington established his headquarters at
                the John Kane House in the town (now the village) for two months in 1778. The town was founded in 1788,
                but part of the town was used to form the neighboring town of Dover in 1807. The town of Pawling was
                part of the Beekman Patent, a large land grant to Col. Henry Beekman in 1697.</p>
